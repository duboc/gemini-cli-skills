# Visual Explainer

Generate beautiful, self-contained HTML pages that visually explain systems, code changes, plans, and data.

## When Does It Activate?

The skill activates when you ask for visual explanations or when complex tabular data would benefit from browser rendering.

|---------|---------|
| Diagram | "Draw a diagram of the authentication flow" |
| Architecture overview | "Show me the system architecture" |
| Diff review | "Review this diff visually" |
| Plan review | "Compare this plan against the codebase" |
| Project recap | "Give me a project recap for context-switching" |
| Comparison table | "Compare these three frameworks" |
| Visual explanation | "Visually explain how the event pipeline works" |
| Complex table rendering | Automatically triggered when rendering 4+ rows or 3+ columns |
