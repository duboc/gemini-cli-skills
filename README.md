### Database Migration (Sybase to Cloud Spanner)

Sybase migration skills have moved to their own repository: [sybase-migration-toolkit](https://github.com/duboc/sybase-migration-toolkit)

## Installation

### Method 1: Gemini CLI native install

```bash
gemini skills install https://github.com/duboc/gemini-cli-skills.git --path skills/<skill-name>
```

Example:

```bash
gemini skills install https://github.com/duboc/gemini-cli-skills.git --path skills/software-troubleshooter
```

### Method 2: One-liner with curl

The install script downloads only the requested skill from GitHub (no git clone needed).

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/duboc/gemini-cli-skills/main/scripts/install.sh | bash -s -- <skill-name>
```

By default, skills install to the **workspace** scope (`.gemini/skills/<name>/` in your current directory). To install for your user profile instead:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/duboc/gemini-cli-skills/main/scripts/install.sh | bash -s -- <skill-name> --scope user
```

### Method 3: Manual download

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Copy the desired skill folder into your Gemini skills directory:
   ```bash
   cp -r skills/software-troubleshooter ~/.gemini/skills/software-troubleshooter
   ```
